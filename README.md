# Invoice pre-processing and sorting script

The following script is a stripped-down version of the production code and it was used in the early stages of the
project as a prototype to show the functioning of the actual appication. 
Any sensitive information has been replaced due to confidentiality clauses.

The goal of the project was to automate the manipulation, classification and sorting of wholesale invoices.
The featured script is part of an internal production application developed for the finance back office 
of a tech retailer. The present script is complemented by an NLP classifier extracting the key
information for different invoicing and rebate documents. All the processed documents, after being classified,
are saved to the correct location in a local database and processing logs are generated for debugging and 
analytics purposes.
